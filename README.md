# C++ Web Server Adapter implementation for Boost Asio

## Build

The easiest way to deal with the cpp-boostasio-webserver-adapter is just open the "CMakeLists.txt" with your QtCreator. However, since it is a CMake project, you don't really need an "IDE" to work with. 

You can build the project from source directly from command line following these steps:  

(In cpp-boostasio-webserver-adapter folder)  

	$mkdir build  
	$cd build  
	$cmake ..

Windows:  

	-	CMake will create a Visual Studio Solution from where you can easily modify and compile your project.  

POSIX:  
	-	CMake will create a Makefile from where you can build your binaries by simply calling "$make" command.
